## Multivariable generalized additive regression models

For each pathogen, we used generalized additive models (GAMs) to measure non-linear relationships between mobility and Rt and to assess the relative importance of different behavioral indicators in predicting Rt during key epidemiological timepoints:
*	2019-2020 winter season, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic
	*	Runtime: 2 minutes
*	The first months of each of four COVID-19 waves
	*	Runtime: < 30 seconds
*	The first months of rebound of non-enveloped viruses in 2020
	*	Runtime: < 30 seconds
*	The first months of rebound of enveloped viruses in 2021
	*	Runtime: < 40 seconds
*	The decline of endemic virus circulation during the Omicron BA.1 wave in late 2021
	*	Runtime: 1 minute

To reduce the confounding effects of susceptible depletion on Rt, GAMs are fit to the exponential growth phase of each outbreak, when Rt exceeds 1 and susceptible depletion is limited.
